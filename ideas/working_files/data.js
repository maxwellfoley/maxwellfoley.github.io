			"title": "Water Level Controller using Mictrocontroller",
			"description": "This project monitors the water level of the tank and automatically switches on the pump motor when ever tank is empty. The motor is switched off automatically when container or overhead tank is full. The main principle used in this project is “water conducts electricity”. In this project water level of the overhead tank is indicated on a 16*2 LCD. In this system a set of 4 wires which are placed at different water levels can be used to sense the water levels. Based on the outputs of these wires controller displays the water level as well as controls the pump motor.",

All the tracks put together form a graph. Trains, with an ID and a name, Train schedules recording what time a train passes through each station on its route. You can assume for simplicity that each train reaches its destination on the same day, and that every train runs every day. Also for simplicity, assume that for each train, for each station on its route,  you store Time in, Time out (same as time in if it does not stop). A sequence number so the stations in the route of a train can be ordered by sequence number. Passenger booking consisting of train, date, from-station, to-station, coach, seat and passenger name.",
